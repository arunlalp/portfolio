# Portfolio template — Arun Lal

This is a minimal, responsive portfolio template scaffolded to let you host your resume and projects.

Files added
- `index.html` — single-page site with sections (About, Experience, Projects, Skills, Contact).
- `styles.css` — responsive styling with CSS variables for easy theming.
- `scripts.js` — small JS for year display, mobile nav toggle, and smooth scroll.
- `assets/ARUN LAL RESUME.pdf` — placeholder path for your resume PDF. Add your resume at this path to enable the "Download Resume" button.

How to preview locally

1. Open `index.html` in a browser. On macOS you can double-click the file or run:

```bash
open index.html
```

2. Replace placeholder text in `index.html` with content from your resume, or share the PDF and I can extract and populate it for you.

Publishing

- To publish via GitHub Pages, push this repository to GitHub and enable Pages from the `main` branch (`/` root) in repository settings.

Next steps I can help with

- Extract text from your resume PDF and populate sections automatically.
- Improve styling to match your preferred colors/branding.
- Add projects with screenshots and live/source links.
- Add analytics, contact form (serverless), or deploy pipeline.

If you want I can extract your resume contents now — either paste the text or upload the PDF into this repo (place at `assets/ARUN LAL RESUME.pdf`).
